## Getting Started

This is a modern version of Stack Overflow, inspired by Javascript Mastery and their Pro course. https://courses.jsmastery.pro.

Packages used:
ClerkJS for Auth
Svix for webhooks
MongoDB for a database, using NextJS and server components to perform actions off the client.
Shadcn-UI for re-usable components
TailwindCSS with custom classes for light and dark themes
TinyMce for a Rich Text Editor
Prism for code formatting.

## Project Status

Project is about 95 % complete.

## Next steps -

Configuring a virtual private server to enable the AI answer function to work - vercel's free tier does not allow for outside requests that take so long.
